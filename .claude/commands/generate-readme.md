# Generate README Command

A command to generate or update a comprehensive README.md file by orchestrating the 'readme-generator' agent and providing it with the necessary context.

## Execution Workflow

The command MUST follow this specific workflow without deviation:

1.  **Prepare Analysis File**:
    - **CRITICAL**: First, run the command `npm run docs:combine` to generate the `fileoverview-collection.json` file. This file is essential for the agent's analysis.

2.  **Gather Full Context**:
    - Collect and prepare the following sources of information to be passed to the agent:
        - The content of the generated `fileoverview-collection.json`.
        - The content of `package.json` (for dependencies and project info).
        - The content of `CLAUDE.md` (for high-level feature insights).
        - The full codebase via the code context provider.
        - The content of the existing `README.md` file (if one exists for an update).

3.  **Invoke Agent**:
    - Launch the `readme-generator` agent.
    - Pass all context gathered in the previous step to the agent for its comprehensive analysis.

4.  **Generate README**:
    - The agent will process the context and generate the new `README.md` file, overwriting the old one if it exists. The agent is responsible for the final content and formatting.

5.  **Cleanup**:
    - After the `README.md` file is successfully generated, run the command `npm run docs:clean` to remove any temporary files created during the process.

## Expected Output Structure

The final `README.md` generated by the agent MUST adhere to the highly-specific structure defined within its own prompt. The orchestrator should validate that the output:

-   **Includes ONLY**: A Header (Title, Tagline, Badges), Core Features Table, Detailed Feature Sections, and a Getting Started Guide.
-   **Explicitly Excludes**: A detailed technology table, development status section, contributing guidelines, license information, or any other section not part of the required structure.
