Generate a new command

You must assist the user with creating a new command, based on their input: #$ARGUMENTS

If the user specifies it needs an input, you must use #$ ARGUMENTS (without the space). This is how you provide the user's input to yourself (when this command you're making is ran)

Commands are located here : .claude\commands

You must create them like command-name.md, and structure them like optimized instructions for yourself
